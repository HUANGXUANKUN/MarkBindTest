<variable name="example">
To inject this HTML segment in your markbind files, use {{ example }} where you want to place it.
More generally, surround the segment's id with double curly braces.
</variable>

<variable name= "ReusingContent">
MarkBind is highly-optimized for content reuse. It offers several mechanisms to provide readers with many variations of the content while minimizing duplication at source file level. As a result, instead of creating a one-size-fits-all site, MarkBind can create a site in which readers can chart their own path of reading.

## Dynamic Programming

>The **O(V+E)** Dynamic Programming algorithm can solve special case of **SSSP problem**, i.e. when the input graph is a ++Directed Acyclic Graph(DAG)++ thus we can find at least one ~~tropicology~~ topological order of the DAG and process the ****edge relaxation**** according to this ****topological order****.
>
>>On the Modified Dijkstra's killer example shown above, DP(0) works fast as the graph is actually a DAG, albeit having negative weight edge. As the graph is a DAG, there will not be any negative weight cycle to worry about.
