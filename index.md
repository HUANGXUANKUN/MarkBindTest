## Dynamic Programming

>The **O(V+E)** Dynamic Programming algorithm can solve special case of **SSSP problem**, i.e. when the input graph is a ++Directed Acyclic Graph(DAG)++ thus we can find at least one ~~tropicology~~ topological order of the DAG and process the ****edge relaxation**** according to this ****topological order****.
>
>>On the Modified Dijkstra's killer example shown above, DP(0) works fast as the graph is actually a DAG, albeit having negative weight edge. As the graph is a DAG, there will not be any negative weight cycle to worry about.
